# Consuming an API secured with OAuth2

This document provides guidance on how to consume an API that is secured using the OAuth2 security scheme.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Integration as API configured with OAuth2 security in Devant. Refer to the [API Security](../../api-security/) documentation for details on setting up OAuth2 security for your API.
- The Integration as API is promoted to the Production environment.

## Steps to Consume an OAuth2 Secured API

1. Sign in to [Devant](https://console.devant.dev).
2. Select your project and navigate to the **Overview** page in the left navigation.
3. Select the Integration as API that you want to consume.
4. In the Integration **Overview** page, on the right side, click **Developer Portal**. This will open the Developer Portal for the selected API.
5. In the Developer Portal, click **Subscribe** to subscribe the API to an application.
6. If you already have an application, select it from the list. If not, enter a name for a new application and click **Create Application**.
7. Once the application is created, click **Subscribe** to complete the subscription process.
8. In the left navigation menu, click **Applications** and select your application.
9. Under the **OAuth2** section of the application details card, click **Generate Key**.
10. A dialog box showing the credentials will appear, which you can close after noting down the necessary details.
11. You can modify the **Advanced Configuration** in the same **OAuth2** section if needed.
12. To test the API, click **Generate** under **Token:** subsection. This will generate an access token using the OAuth2 client credentials flow.

Once you have the access token, you can use it to make authenticated requests to the secured API. Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

An example using `curl` to make a request to the secured API:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url <endpoint> \
  --header 'Accept: text/plain' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
```

You can also click **Documentation** in the **API Overview** page to view the API documentation, and test the API endpoints directly from the Developer Portal using the generated access token.
