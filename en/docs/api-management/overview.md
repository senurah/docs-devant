# API Management Overview

API management is a crucial aspect of modern application development, enabling organizations to efficiently create, publish, secure, monitor, and analyze APIs at scale. Devant offers a comprehensive API management solution that streamlines the lifecycle management of integrations exposed as APIs, ensuring they are easy to manage, monitor, and govern.

With Devant's API management capabilities, you can easily create and publish integrations as APIs, set up security measures such as authentication and authorization, monitor API usage and performance, and analyze API traffic to gain insights into usage patterns. Devant's intuitive interface and powerful features make it easier to manage APIs at scale, ensuring that your applications can communicate seamlessly and securely.

Devant's API management solution includes features such as:

- **Deploying Integrations as APIs**: You can deploy your integrations as APIs, making them accessible to external applications and services.
- **Lifecycle Management**: You can manage the lifecycle of your APIs, from creation to retirement, ensuring that your APIs are always up-to-date and relevant. For more information, refer to the [Lifecycle Management](../lifecycle-management/) documentation.
- **API Security**: Devant supports various security schemes, including `API Key` and `OAuth2`, to protect your APIs from unauthorized access. For more information, refer to the [API Security](../api-security/) documentation. Moreover, you can find detailed guides on how to consume APIs secured with these schemes in the [Consuming APIs](../consuming-apis/consuming-an-api-secured-with-an-api-key/) section.
- **API Rate Limiting**: You can set up rate limiting policies to control API requests, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage. For more information, refer to the [API Rate Limiting](../api-rate-limiting/) documentation.
- **Analytics and Monitoring**: You can monitor API usage and performance, gaining insights into user behavior and identifying potential issues. You can refer to the [Usage Insights](../../monitoring-and-insights/usage-insights-overview/) documentation for more details.
- **Developer Portal**: Devant provides a developer portal where developers can discover, subscribe to, and test APIs, making it easier to onboard new users and applications. Moreover, users can customize the Developer Portal to align with their branding and provide a seamless experience for their developers.
- **API Policies**: Devant enables no-code business logic and mediation—such as JSON↔XML payload transformation, header/query parameter manipulation, and environment-specific flexibility—across requests, responses, and error flows.
